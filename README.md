## What is Tampermonkey?
Tampermonkey is a popular browser extension that allows users to run custom JavaScript code on websites. It is commonly used to enhance website functionality, automate repetitive tasks, or modify the behavior of web pages.
Tampermonkey is compatible with userscripts (files with the `.user.js` extension), which define the custom JavaScript code and the conditions under which it should run.

## How to Install Tampermonkey
1. Open your browser's extensions/add-ons store.
2. Search for "Tampermonkey."
3. Install the extension and enable it.
4. Once installed, the Tampermonkey icon will appear in your browser toolbar.

Note: Sometimes the extension needs browser "developer mode" to be enabled to run. The extension will show you the notification in case.

Alternatively, visit [Tampermonkey's official website](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for installation instructions and download links.

## How Tampermonkey Works
Tampermonkey manages and executes userscripts based on their metadata, which specifies:
- The websites where the script should run.
- Permissions the script requires (e.g., accessing external APIs).

When you load a website, Tampermonkey checks its list of scripts and runs any that match the current URL or conditions.

## How Tampermonkey Integrates JavaScript
Tampermonkey extends JavaScript functionality by:
1. **Custom Execution Context:** Scripts run independently from the website's own JavaScript, preventing conflicts.
2. **Metadata Block:** Scripts include a header section with metadata (e.g., `@name`, `@match`, `@grant`) that informs Tampermonkey about their purpose and scope.
3. **Enhanced APIs:** Tampermonkey provides additional APIs for tasks like:
   - Making cross-origin HTTP requests (`GM_xmlhttpRequest`).
   - Displaying desktop notifications (`GM_notification`).
   - Managing persistent storage (`GM_setValue`, `GM_getValue`).

## Example Userscript: Salah Time Notifier
This script, "Salah Time Notifier," is a Tampermonkey userscript that:
1. Fetches Salah (prayer) times using the Aladhan API.
2. Displays the next Salah time on all websites.
3. Flashes a notification 10 minutes before Salah until dismissed by the user.

### Key Features
- Automatically updates the next Salah time.
- Provides a user-friendly notification mechanism.
- Runs seamlessly across all websites.

The userscript is saved as `salah_time_notifier.user.js` and includes metadata to specify its behavior and permissions.

### Code Attribution
The code for "Salah Time Notifier" was generated by ChatGPT, a large language model developed by OpenAI. It demonstrates the integration of Tampermonkey's extended JavaScript APIs and web development best practices.

## Getting Started with Your Own Userscripts
1. Click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser.
2. Select "Create a new script."
3. Replace the default code with your own JavaScript, including a metadata block.
4. Save the script, and Tampermonkey will automatically run it on matching websites.

### Use ChatGPT to generate
1. ChatGPT is an efficient tool on getting started with the these type of codes
2. Ask ChatGPT with a proper prompt including
   - What you want to create
   - What kind of appearance
   - What is the functionality going to be (Detailed)
   - Where/Which sites you want to intgrate it to
   - Finally hit enter
